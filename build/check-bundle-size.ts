  // Glass each ship their own token block, and the liquid-glass material
  // layer (SVG displacement filters plus their component rules) adds the
  // largest share. The measured bundle is 153.7 kB; 175 kB adds headroom for
  // the Developer Hall of Fame page (~15 kB of animated card and hero
  // styles that load only on /donate.html). Raised to 180 kB in the
  // same pass as the 175 kB target, then to 195 kB for the Minecraft Hall of
  // Fame overhaul: the blocky token block (plank textures, bevels, item-frame
  // avatars), the animated day/night scene (sun/moon/star/cloud/bonfire
  // keyframes) and the credits-style quote widget push the measured CSS
  // aggregate to 183.7 kB.
  ".css": 195_000,
  // Raised from 510 kB for Bridge discovery, profile editing, automatic
  // reconnection, and recent device support, which have since grown further
  // with the supported-device page and MX Master remap controls. Preview
  // fixtures retain their separate allowance below; the measured aggregate
  // is 573.4 kB with them, plus the ~11 kB Hall of Fame chunk. Raised again
  // from 590 kB for the Razer button-mapping card and its codec: the measured
  // aggregate is 588.2 kB, which left under 2 kB of headroom. Raised again to
  // 610 kB for the Pulsar XS-1 feature-report driver and 4K receiver support
  // (mouse-protocol 3c3a445): the X3 family codec plus the 4K DPI/polling work
  // adds ~1.3 kB to the measured aggregate. Raised to 632 kB for the Attack
  // Shark GearHub (0x25a7) protocol routed to 0x1d57 VID devices (+1.6 kB).
  // Raised to 700 kB for four new drivers landing together: Keychron M6,
  // Keychron Nape Pro (layer/keymap/orientation controls), Glorious Model O
  // 2/I 2 lighting, and SteelSeries Rival 3 Gen 1. Measured aggregate is
  // 689.0 kB, which leaves about 11 kB of headroom. Raised to 730 kB for the
  // device artwork pass: ~20 new product models mapped to transparent top-view
  // renders in device-images.ts (PID keys plus name fallbacks) add ~22 kB of
  // mapping code to the measured aggregate (720.5 kB). Raised to 765 kB for
  // the SteelSeries/device-support and Cloudflare R2 artwork-serve work merged
  // on dev: those land with the measured aggregate already at ~750 kB. The
  // donate page rebuild (Hall of Fame -> Support) does not drive this; its
  // rebuilt donate chunk is lighter than the old Minecraft-themed hof chunk it
  // replaced. 765 kB leaves ~15 kB of headroom over the measured aggregate.
  // Raised to 790 kB for the MCHOSE A7 V2 mouse and MagDock driver support:
  // the measured aggregate is 779.1 kB, leaving ~11 kB of headroom.
